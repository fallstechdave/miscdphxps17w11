dual boot windows 11 and ubuntu

https://windowsreport.com/dual-boot-windows-11-ubuntu/

Install Ubuntu after Windows 11
1. Create a dedicated Ubuntu partition
Open Disk Management. You can do that by pressing Windows Key + X and selecting Disk Management from the list.

Now you need to select a drive that you want to shrink. Choose one that has at least 50GB of free space, but if you’re planning to use Ubuntu extensively, you might need even more space.
Right-click the desired drive and choose Shrink Volume from the context menu.

So, open the disk management utility by pressing Windows Key + R
In the dialogue box, type diskmgmt.msc and hit ENTER.

dual boot windows 11 and ubuntu bitlocker

https://askubuntu.com/questions/1369189/windows-11-ubuntu-and-bitlocker

https://techschumz.com/install-ubuntu-along-with-windows-11-in-dual-boot/

https://itsfoss.com/dual-boot-ubuntu-windows-bitlocker/

So, why I am I writing about installing Ubuntu with Windows 10 once again? Because these days Windows 10 Pro version comes with BitLocker encryption and hence when you try to dual boot like normal, it either refuses or creates issue.

How do I disable Bitlocker on my Windows 11 computer?

1. Disabling from the Context Menu
Open the File Explorer and click on This PC.
Right-click the encrypted drive.
Turn off Bitlocker or Manage Bitlocker should appear on the new menu. If it doesn’t, click Show more options.
Click Manage BitLocker to bring up the BitLocker Drive Encyption menu.
In this new menu, click Turn off BitLocker.
A small window will appear telling you that the drive will be decrypted. It may take a while depending on the driver’s size.
Click Turn off BitLocker.
Give your computer time to decrypt the drive. To give you an idea of how long it took, it took BitLocker 10 minutes to decrypt in this example.
Once done, the BitLocker Drive Encryption menu will state that the feature has been turned off.

2. Disabling via BitLocker Manager

Click the magnifying glass icon to bring up the Search bar.
In the Search bar, type in “bitlocker.”
Click Manage BitLocker when it appears.
The Manager BitLocker is exactly the same as the BitLocker Drive Encryption menu from the previous section.
Click Turn off Bitlocker on the right.
Like before, click the Turn off Bitlocker button and give the app some time to decrypt. Depending on the size, it may take a long time.
